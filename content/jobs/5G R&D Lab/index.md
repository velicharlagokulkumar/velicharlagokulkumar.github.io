- Implemented basic 5G NR Physical Layer (L1) Baseband hardware modules for the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) channel.
- Worked with AXI bridges and interconnects between PS and PL, specifically in Intel FPGA.
- Developed moderate-level C code for L1 and L1 Controller interactions on the PS, ensuring smooth hand-off and alignment with hardware requirements.
- Gained a basic understanding of custom clock configurations for ADC and DAC systems and for FPGA clocks in Xilinx Zynq RF SoC and TI AFE platforms.
- Worked on integrating high-speed transceivers and validating system performance for 5G applications.
